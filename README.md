# Building-GAN
Code that will help understand Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in nural networks and deep learning.

Building a simple GAN capable of generating handwritten digits. 
Using the MNIST handwritten digits to train the network. Using the TensorFlow Keras dataset to access the MNIST data. 
The data contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits each of size 28 x 28.  
Then, training variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate new images. 

Redoing the project that tries to reconstruct handwritten digits. 
After redoing the project, Giving interpretation of the power of the autoencoder for dimensionality reduction.
